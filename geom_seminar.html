Title: Equivariant localization theorem
   </strong></em>
   </p>
   <p class="abstract">
Abstract: The Atiyah-Bott localization theorem says that the equivariant cohomology of a space can be recovered, up to inverting some elements, from the equivariant cohomology of the fixed point subspace. We discuss a categorified version of this result which allows us to deduce the theorem for all oriented theories (cohomology and Borel-Moore homology). This is based on a joint work with Adeel Khan.

   <p class="abstract">
Abstract: The Rost nilpotence principle is an important tool in the study of motivic decompositions of smooth projective varieties over a field. I will introduce Chow motives, the Rost nilpotence principle and briefly survey the cases in which it is known to hold. Voevodsky's proof of the Bloch-Kato conjecture yields powerful motivic techniques, which enable one to precisely write down the obstruction for the Rost nilpotence principle to hold. I will outline some recent work on the determination of these obstructions.

 Abstract: We construct a new anticyclotomic Euler system for the Galois
representation attached to a modular form of weight $2k$, twisted by an
anticyclotomic Hecke character $\chi$ of infinity type $(m,-m)$, denoted
$V_{f,\chi}$, when the Heegner hypothesis is not satisfied and $m\ge k$. If
time permits, we will then show some arithmetic applications (in a joint
work with F. Castella) of the constructed Euler system, including
evidence of the Bloch-Kato Conjecture and the Iwasawa Main Conjecture
for $V_{f,\chi}$.

     Title: Species and dimension formulas for period spaces
   </strong></em>
   </p>
   <p class="abstract">
 Abstract: (joint work with Martin Kalck)
Periods are complex numbers obtained by integrating algebraic
differential forms over $\mathbf{Q}$ over a domain of algebraic nature.
This includes numbers like $\pi$, $\log(2)$ or the values of the Riemann
zeta function at integers. More conceptually, periods are the entries of
the period pairing between the singular and de Rham realisation of a
mixed motive over $\mathbf{Q}$. The period conjecture makes a sweeping
qualitative prediction on the relations between period numbers, e.g.,
that $\pi$ is transcendental.

We develop and apply the abstract theory of a very special class of
Noetherian rings, namely finite dimensional $\mathbf{Q}$-algebras, in
order to deduce formulas for the expected dimension of the space of
periods of a single motive. This is of particular interest in the case
of $1$-motives (or periods of curves), where the linear version of the
period conjecture is a theorem due to Huber and Wüstholz.

     Title: Towards new Euler systems for automorphic Galois representations
   </strong></em>
   </p>
   <p class="abstract">
 Abstract: The construction of Euler systems for Galois representations
associated to automorphic forms often relies on the existence of
Rankin-Selberg integrals which calculate the corresponding $\mathrm{L}$-function. I
will discuss a new Rankin-Selberg integral, which represents a twist of
the degree $5$ $\mathrm{L}$-function of cusp forms on $GSp_4$, and its potential
application to the study of the arithmetic of the standard Galois
representation associated to cusp forms on $GSp_4$. This is joint work with
Armando Gutierrez.

 Abstract: I will explain a joint work with Juan Esteban Rodríguez Camargo, where we develop new foundations for the theory of locally analytic representations of a p-adic Lie group through the use of condensed mathematics. As an application of this new formalism, I will explain a geometric interpretation of the category of locally analytic representations and, if time permits, some comparison results between different cohomology theories for solid representations.

     A criterion of completability of unimodular rows over non-singular affine
domain of dimension $d$
   </strong></em>
   </p>
   <p class="abstract">
 In this talk we first prove that for regular local ring $R$ containing
an infinite field, the natural map $SL_r(R[X], (X^2-X))/E_r(R[X], (X^2-X))\rightarrow  SK_1(R[X],
(X^2-X))$ is an isomorphism for $r\geq3$. Then we prove that for a
smooth affine domain $R$ over an infinite field of dimension $d$, a
unimodular row of length $d+1$ over $R$ is completable, if $${\rm
Um}_{d+1}(Q(R)[X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d],(X_1^2-X_1)(X_2^2-X_2)\dots
(X_d^2-X_d))=
e_1 SL_{d+1}(Q(R)[X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d],(X_1^2-X_1)(X_2^2-X_2)\dots(X_d^2-X_d)),$$
where $Q(R)$ is the quotient field of $R$. This is a joint work with
Prof. Ravi A. Rao.

 In 1996 using techniques from model theory and intersection theory, Hrushovski obtained a generalization of the Lang-Weil estimates. Subsequently, the estimate has found applications in group theory, algebraic dynamics, and algebraic geometry. We shall discuss an $l$-adic proof of these estimates' non-uniform version and the rationality of the associated generating function.

A p-Adic

We explain how Clausen-Scholze's condensed mathematics can be used to
construct a 6-functor formalism for p-adic sheaves on rigid varieties
(i.e. "p-adic manifolds"), which in particular implies p-adic Poincaré
duality in this setting. When applied to classifying stacks of p-adic
groups, this 6-functor formalism provides new insights into the p-adic
Langlands program.

Class field theory for schemes over local fields 
   </strong></em>
   </p>
   <p class="abstract">
 The (tame) class field theory for a smooth variety $X$ is the study of describing the
abelianized (tame) {\'e}tale fundamental group of $X$ in terms of some groups which are defined using algebraic cycles of $X$. 
<br><br>

In this talk, we study the tame class field theory for smooth varieties over local fields. We will begin with defining few notions and recalling various results from the past to overview the historical background of the subject. We will then study abelianized tame fundamental group denoted as $\pi^{ab,t}_{1}(X)$, with the help of reciprocity map $\rho^{t}_{X} : C^{t}(X) \rightarrow \pi^{ab,t}_{1}(X)$ and will describe the kernel and topological cokernel of this map. This talk is based on a joint work with Prof. Amalendu Krishna and Dr. Rahul Gupta.

Building on Toen's work on higher (affine) stacks, I will

``unipotent homotopy theory". Over a field of char. $p>0$, I will explain
how our unipotent homotopy group schemes recover (1) unipotent
completion of the Nori fundamental group scheme, (2) p-adic étale
homotopy groups, and (3) certain formal group laws arising from
algebraic varieties constructed by Artin--Mazur. Joint work with Emanuel
Reinecke.
