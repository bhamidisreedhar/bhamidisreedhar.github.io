     Absolute Gromov-Witten theory is known to have many nice structural properties, such as quantum cohomology, WDVV equation,
Givental's formalism, mirror theorem, CohFT etc.. In this talk, I will explain how to obtain parallel structures for relative Gromov-Witten
theory via the relationship between relative and orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants. If time permits, I will also talk about the generalization to simple normal crossings pairs and some applications in mirror symmetry.

    Intrinsic Mirror Symmetry and Categorical Crepant Resolutions
    </strong></em>
   </p>
   <p class="abstract">
     A general expectation in mirror symmetry is that the mirror partner to an affine log Calabi-Yau variety is "semi-affine" (meaning it is proper over its affinization). We will discuss how the semi-affineness of the mirror can be seen directly as certain finiteness properties of Floer theoretic invariants of $X$ (the symplectic cohomology and wrapped Fukaya category). One interesting consequence of these finiteness results is that, under fairly general circumstances, the wrapped Fukaya of $X$ gives an ("intrinsic") categorical crepant resolution of the affine variety $\mathrm{Spec}(SH^0(X))$. This is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01200"> arxiv:2103.01200</a> .

    <strong><em>
    $(2+1)$ ways of counting tangent curves
    </strong></em>
   </p>
   <p class="abstract">
     Logarithmic Gromov-Witten theory is a framework for counting curves in a fixed variety $\mathrm{X}$, with specified tangency orders to a fixed normal crossings divisor $\mathrm{D}$. The associated moduli spaces of logarithmic stable maps have been extensively studied over the past decade. Despite this, calculating invariants remains a hard problem, and there are relatively few targets for which the theory has been "solved".
<br><br>
In this talk I will explain how tropical combinatorics can be leveraged to control the geometry of these moduli spaces and, ultimately, compute numbers. This point of view leads us to construct a natural iterated blowup of the moduli space of (ordinary) stable maps, whose intersection theory can then be exploited to relate the logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants to other, better-understood curve counts.
<br><br>
This is joint work with Dhruv Ranganathan. No prior knowledge of logarithmic geometry will be assumed.

    <strong><em>
   Frobenius structure conjecture and application to cluster algebras
    </strong></em>
   </p>
   <p class="abstract">
      I will explain the Frobenius structure conjecture of Gross-Hacking-Keel in mirror symmetry, and an application towards cluster algebras. Let U be an affine log Calabi-Yau variety containing an open algebraic torus. We show that the naive counts of rational curves in U uniquely determine a commutative associative algebra equipped with a compatible multilinear form. Although the statement of the theorem involves only elementary algebraic geometry, the proof employs Berkovich non-archimedean analytic methods. We construct the structure constants of the algebra via counting non-archimedean analytic disks in the analytification of U. I will explain various properties of the counting, notably deformation invariance, symmetry, gluing formula and convexity. In the special case when U is a Fock-Goncharov skew-symmetric X-cluster variety, our algebra generalizes, and gives a direct geometric construction of, the mirror algebra of Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich. The comparison is proved via a canonical scattering diagram defined by counting infinitesimal non-archimedean analytic cylinders, without using the Kontsevich-Soibelman algorithm. Several combinatorial conjectures of GHKK, as well as the positivity in the Laurent phenomenon, follow readily from the geometric description. This is joint work with S. Keel, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09861"> arXiv:1908.09861</a>. If time permits, I will mention another application towards the moduli space of KSBA (Kollár-Shepherd-Barron-Alexeev) stable pairs, joint with P. Hacking and S. Keel, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02299"> arXiv: 2008.02299</a>.

    Homological mirror symmetry for nodal stacky curves
    </strong></em>

   <p class="abstract">
     In this talk, I will explain the proof of homological mirror symmetry where the B-model is a ring or chain of stacky projective lines joined nodally, and where each irreducible component is allowed to have a non-trivial generic stabiliser. This generalises the work of Lekili and Polishchuk, and is motivated by the study of invertible polynomials. In particular, this work establishes homological mirror symmetry where the B--model is taken to be an invertible polynomial in two variables with not-necessarily-maximal grading group. In the maximally graded case, one can show that the mirror is graded symplectomorphic to the Milnor fibre of the transpose invertible polynomial, thus establishing the Lekili-Ueda conjecture in complex dimension one.

     On the categorical enumerative invariants of a point
    </strong></em>
   </p>
   <p class="abstract">
 
We briefly recall the definition of categorical enumerative invariants (CEI) first introduced by Costello around 2005. Costello's construction relies fundamentally on Sen-Zwiebach’s notion of string vertices $V_{g,n}$’s which are chains on moduli space of smooth curves $M_{g,n}$’s. In this talk, we explain the relationship between string vertices and the fundamental classes of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of $M_{g,n}$. More precisely, we obtain a Feynman sum formula expressing the fundamental classes in terms of string vertices. As an immediate application, we prove a comparison result that the CEI of the field $\mathbb{Q}$ is the same as the Gromov-Witten invariants of a point.

     Refinements of higher rank DT invariants

Let $n > 0$ be an integer. The Quot scheme of length $n$ quotients of the free sheaf $\mathcal{O}^r$ on affine space $\mathbb{A}^3$ is the main character in “rank $r$ (local) Donaldson-Thomas theory”. We will explain how to attach several types of invariants (enumerative, motivic, cohomological, $\mathrm{K}$-theoretic) to this Quot scheme, and show that the resulting generating functions (varying $n$) have nice plethystic expressions. In particular, the $\mathrm{K}$-theoretic formula completely solves the higher rank DT theory of $\mathbb{A}^3$, confirming the Awata-Kanno Conjecture in String Theory. This part is joint work with Nadir Fasola and Sergej Monavari.

    The quantum Lefschetz principle allows one to know the Gromov-Witten

invariants of the zero locus of a section of a vector bundle from those

the virtual fundamental classes of the moduli stacks of stable maps to

these schemes, algebraic cycles obtained from a construction which can

appear somewhat mysterious. In this talk, I will explain how, through

derived geometry, one can interpret this result as a purely geometric

phenomenon, and deduce a categorification of the formula for virtual

   $3d$ mirror symmetry
    </strong></em>
   </p>
   <p class="abstract">
    One of the recent remarkable discoveries is the connection between quantum K-theory and $3d$ TQFT.  For a long time, quantum K-theory has been viewed as a variant to quantum cohomology, which comes from a $2d$ TQFT. $3d$ physics has its own mirror symmetry phenomenon, which falls into two versions, for $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories versus $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories. There are many mathematical results on the enumerative-geometric aspect of $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror symmetry by Okounkov's group. Our main interest is in $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories, which apply to a general Kähler manifold. Its mirror symmetry was poorly understood even in physics. 

In this talk, I will introduce a new version of $3d$ mirror symmetry for toric stacks, inspired by a $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian mirror symmetry construction in physics introduced by Dorey-Tong. More precisely, for a short exact sequence
                                            $$   0 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^{n-k} \rightarrow 0,$$
we consider the toric Artin stack $[C^n/(C^*)^k]$, and its mirror is given by the Gale dual of the above exact sequence, i.e., $[C^n/(C^*)^{n-k}]$. We introduce the modified equivariant $\mathrm{K}$-theoretic $\mathrm{I}$-functions for the mirror pair; they are defined by the contribution of fixed points. Under the mirror map, which switches the Kälher parameters and equivariant parameters and maps $q$ to $q^{-1}$, we see that modified $\mathrm{I}$-functions with the effective level structure of mirror pair coincide. This talk is based on the joint work with Yongbin Ruan and Zijun Zhou.

     We would like to discuss the multiplicative property of localised Chern characters for complexes constructed by Baum-Fulton-MacPherson and Polishchuk-Vaintrob.

The key idea of our discussion is to show this is not only extensions of terms but also an extension of the complex.
